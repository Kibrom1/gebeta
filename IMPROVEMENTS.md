# Gebeta Game - Code Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Gebeta game codebase to enhance maintainability, performance, accessibility, and user experience.

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### 1. Component Refactoring
- **Split large components**: Broke down the 900+ line `GebetaGame.js` into smaller, focused components:
  - `GameBoard.js` - Handles game board rendering and interactions
  - `GameControls.js` - Manages online/offline controls and game actions
  - `GameStatus.js` - Displays player scores and game status
  - `GameEndModal.js` - Handles game end modal display

### 2. Custom Hooks Implementation
- **`useGameLogic.js`** - Centralized game state management
- **`useWebSocket.js`** - WebSocket connection handling with reconnection logic
- **`useGameResults.js`** - Game results and statistics management
- **`useSounds.js`** - Audio management with error handling
- **`useDebounce.js`** - Performance optimization for user inputs

### 3. Utility Functions
- **`gameUtils.js`** - Pure functions for game logic:
  - `calculateMovePath()` - Calculate seed movement paths
  - `processMoveResult()` - Process game moves with validation
  - `getComputerMove()` - AI move calculation
  - `createGameResult()` - Game result formatting

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations
