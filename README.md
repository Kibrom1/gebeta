# Gebeta (ገበጣ) – Ethiopian Mancala Game

Welcome to Gebeta, a modern digital version of the traditional Ethiopian Mancala game! This app lets you play Gebeta with friends locally or online, enjoy cultural branding, animated gameplay, and track your game history.

## How to Use Gebeta

### 1. Starting a Game
- When you open the app, you'll be prompted to enter player names. You can use your real names or nicknames.
- Click **Start Game** to begin.

### 2. Game Board & UI
- The board has two rows of houses (6 per player) and two stores (one for each player).
- Player 1 (Blue) is at the bottom; Player 2 (Red) is at the top.
- Each house contains seeds (represented by animated dots). Click on your houses to make a move when it's your turn.
- Your avatar and name appear next to your label for easy identification.

### 3. Making Moves
- On your turn, click any of your houses with seeds to distribute them counterclockwise.
- Seeds move one by one, animated for clarity.
- If your last seed lands in your store, you get another turn.
- If your last seed lands in an empty house on your side and the opposite house has seeds, you capture those seeds.

### 4. Game Status & Log
- The current player, scores, and game status are shown at the top.
- The **Game Log** records recent moves and events for reference.

### 5. Ending & Restarting
- The game ends when one player has no seeds left in their houses.
- The winner is the player with the most seeds in their store.
- After a game, you can view results, see the highest scorer, and start a new game (with new names if you wish).

### 6. Online Multiplayer
- Click **Play Online** to enable online mode.
- You can **Create Game** (become host) or **Join Game** using a Game ID.
- Wait for your opponent to join, then play in real time. Moves are synced automatically.
- Online play requires a WebSocket server (see app documentation for setup).

### 7. Cultural Branding & Accessibility
- The app features a custom logo with Amharic text (ገበጣ) and a cultural note about Gebeta.
- Colors and backgrounds are chosen for harmony and accessibility.

### 8. Game History & Scoring

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
